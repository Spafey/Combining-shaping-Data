# Data
A collection of data science projects to develop proficiency.

the first project looks at the top-rated apps in the Google play store, using a dataset available from Pluralsight's online learning platform. a similar version of this dataset is available from https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps/data

Play-store datasheets were combined in EXCEL, using VLOOKUP, INDEX & MATCH functions, with some descriptive statistics generated using SUM, ROUNDAVERAGE, & COUNTIF; these aggregations yielded values such as average rating, total reviews, the average number of reviews per app, & the total number of free & paid apps in the dataset.

# Data
A collection of data science projects using various frameworks to combine and examine data, in order to develop proficiency.

This project began with the merging of pre-scraped datasets related to the Google play store. an updated version of this dataset is available from https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps/data, though in this instance unmodified datasets were taken from a repository on Pluralsight's online platform, and have also been included.

Data was combined using VLOOKUP, INDEX & MATCH functions.

# Data

A collection of data science projects, in order to develop proficiency.

This project began with the merging of pre-scraped datasets relating to the most popular Google play store apps. An updated version of this dataset is available from https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps/data, though for this practice an unmodified dataset was available from Pluralsight's online learning platform.        

To begin with datasheets were combined using VLOOKUP, INDEX & MATCH functions. Some descriptive statistics were then generated using   SUM, ROUNDAVERAGE, & COUNTIF functions; these yielded average ratings, total reviews, the average number of reviews per app, & the total number of free & paid apps in the dataset. 

This was followed by a small project utilyzing PowerQuery to import car sales data from several sources into one sheet.
